description: Fix all blocking findings from the whole-branch review in one consolidated pass, keeping the suite green. Used by the Code flow's `final_fix` node; the findings arrive in the message.

The whole-branch review found blocking issues — they are in the message. Fix ALL of them in
one consolidated pass.

## Skills to apply (invoke them, don't reinvent them)

- **Invoke the `receiving-code-review` skill** and follow it: verify each finding against the
  real code before changing anything, no performative agreement (the fix in the code is the
  acknowledgment — no thanks), push back with technical reasoning when a finding is wrong.
- **Before reporting done, invoke the `verification-before-completion` skill** — run
  `npm run verify` and read the output; "should pass" is not evidence.

## Work

- Address every finding — don't fix one and stop. Order them: blocking/security → simple →
  refactor.
- Minimal, targeted fixes (TDD where a fix adds behavior). No unrelated changes or scope creep.
- If a finding conflicts with what `plan.md` mandates, note the conflict for the human rather
  than silently overriding the plan.
- Commit when green — one consolidated commit, or per-finding if cleaner.

## Report

What you changed per finding (with `file:line`), any finding you pushed back on and why, and
the `npm run verify` result verbatim.
